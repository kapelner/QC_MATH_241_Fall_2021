\begin{abstract}
The path to success in this class is to do many problems. Unlike other courses, exclusively doing reading(s) will not help. Coming to lecture is akin to watching workout videos; thinking about and solving problems on your own is the actual ``working out''.  Feel free to \qu{work out} with others; \textbf{I want you to work on this in groups.}

Reading is still \textit{required}. For this homework set, read the section about foundations of probability in Chapter 2 and the section about conditional probability and in/dependence in Chapter 3. Chapter references are from Rossâ€™s 7th edition. Also read the section about discrete random variables especially the Bernoulli, the Binomial and the Hypergeometric.

The problems below are color coded: \ingreen{green} problems are considered \textit{easy} and marked \qu{[easy]}; \inorange{yellow} problems are considered \textit{intermediate} and marked \qu{[harder]}, \inred{red} problems are considered \textit{difficult} and marked \qu{[difficult]} and \inpurple{purple} problems are extra credit. The \textit{easy} problems are intended to be ``giveaways'' if you went to class. Do as much as you can of the others; I expect you to at least attempt the \textit{difficult} problems.

This homework is worth 100 points but the point distribution will not be determined until after the due date. See syllabus for the policy on late homework.

Up to [see syllabus] points are given as a bonus if the homework is typed using \LaTeX. Links to instaling \LaTeX~and program for compiling \LaTeX~is found on the syllabus. You are encouraged to use \url{overleaf.com}. If you are handing in homework this way, read the comments in the code; there are two lines to comment out and you should replace my name with yours and write your section. If you are asked to make drawings, you can take a picture of your handwritten drawing and insert them as figures or leave space using the \qu{$\backslash$vspace} command and draw them in after printing or attach them stapled.

The document is available with spaces for you to write your answers. If not using \LaTeX, print this document and write in your answers. I do not accept homeworks not on this printout. Keep this first page printed for your records. Write your name below.

\problem{Probability is rooted in gambling and thus we will be analyzing some gambling games. We will introduce the game of Roulette here. Basically, there's a ball that is dropped onto a spinning wheel with pockets for the ball to fall once the wheel and ball run out of momentum. There are 18 red pockets and 18 black pockets. There are two flavors of the game:

\begin{itemize}
\item European: There is one additional pocket colored green and labeled 0 (for a total of 18+18+1=37 pockets). An example of this wheel is pictured below on the left.
\item American: There are two additional pockets colored green labeled 0 and 00 (for a total of 18+18+2=38 pockets). An example of this wheel is pictured below on the right.
\end{itemize}

The gambler can make bets on any of the spaces as well as red (R), black (B), green (G), an odd number, an even number and a slew of other exotic type bets which we won't enumerate. We will be analyzing payoffs when we get to random variables next week but we will not be discussing them now.}

\paragraph{Random Variables} The bulk of this class will be spent on random variables (and almost all of Math 368 is spent on rv's as well). \\ \\
}


\problem{In class we spoke about how random variables map outcomes from the sample space to a number \ie $X: \Omega \rightarrow \reals$. That is they are set functions, just like the probability function which is $\mathbb{P}: 2^\Omega \rightarrow \zeroonecl$. We will be investigating this concept here.

\begin{enumerate}
\easysubproblem{Here is a way to produce $X \sim \bernoulli{\half}$ using the $\Omega$ from a roll of a die. Map outcomes 1,2,3 to 0 and outcomes 4,5,6 to 1. This works because 

\beqn
&&\prob{X=0} = \prob{\braces{\omega : X(\omega) = 0}} = \prob{\braces{1, 2, 3}} = 1/2 ~~\text{and} \\ 
&&\prob{X=1} = \prob{\braces{\omega : X(\omega) = 1}} = \prob{\braces{4, 5, 6}} = 1/2.
\eeqn

Describe two other scenarios or devices that produce their own $\Omega$'s that also result in $X \sim \bernoulli{\half}.$ Be creative (i.e. not boring).} \spc{4}

\intermediatesubproblem{We talked about in class how the sample space no longer needs to be considered once the random variable is described. Why? Use your answer to (a) to inspire this answer. Write it \textit{in English} below.} \spc{3}

\hardsubproblem{Back to philosophy... Let's say $X$ models the price difference that IBM stock moves in one day of trading. For instance, if the stock closed yesterday at \$56.24 and today it closed at \$57.24, the random variable would be \$1 for today. According to our definition of a random variable, there is a sample space with outcomes being drawn ($\omega \in \Omega$) that is \qu{controlling} the value of $X$. Describe it the best you can \textit{in English}. There are no right or wrong answers here, but your answer must be coherent and demonstrate you understand the question.} \spc{6}

\problem{We will now study probability mass functions (PMF's) denoted as $p(x)$ and cumulative distribution functions (CDF's) denoted as $F(X)$ and review the r.v.'s we did in class.}

\easysubproblem{What is the parameter space of $X$ where $X \sim \bernoulli{p}$ and why?}  \spc{1.5}


%\hardsubproblem{Sometimes knowing the $\Omega$ matters a little bit. Let's say $X_1 \sim \bernoulli{\half}$ is generated from one coin and $X_2 \sim \bernoulli{\half}$ is generated from another coin independently tossed. Create a new r.v. $T = X_1 + X_2$. Describe its PMF using the $\sim$ notation like in the previous problem. Thus write \qu{$T \sim$} something.} \spc{13}

\hardsubproblem{Consider the PMF we discussed for $X \sim \bernoulli{\half}$. Does $\myint{x}{}{}{p(x)} = F(x) + C$ where the constant $C \in \reals$? Explain. Think carefully about what integration really means.} \spc{5}

\hardsubproblem{How about the opposite? Consider the CDF we discussed for $X \sim \bernoulli{\half}$. Does $\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x}[F(x)] = p(x)$? Explain. Think carefully about what differentiation really means.} \spc{3}
